# DeepShake: Shaking Intensity Prediction Using Deep Spatiotemporal RNNs

## Overview
DeepShake is an innovative approach to earthquake early warning systems, leveraging a deep spatiotemporal recurrent neural network to predict future shaking intensity based on current ground-motion observations. Developed with data from the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake sequence, DeepShake aims to enhance early warning capabilities by forecasting modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) IV+ shaking across a network of stations without prior knowledge of station locations.

## Key Features
- **Network-based Forecasting:** Predicts future shaking intensity at all network stations using measured ground shaking data.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes deep spatiotemporal neural networks to learn wave propagation amplitudes and delays directly from seismic data.
- **High Performance:** Achieved an equal error rate of 11.4% on 3,568 validation earthquakes, demonstrating its potential for accurate and timely alerts.
- **Significant Impact:** For the 7.1 magnitude Ridgecrest earthquake on July 5, 2019, DeepShake successfully provided alerts 5 seconds before the arrival of MMI IV+ waveforms to all stations within the network.
